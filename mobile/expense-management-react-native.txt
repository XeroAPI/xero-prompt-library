Build a React Native expense tracking app that integrates with Xero for 
automatic expense report creation. Implement OAuth 2.0 with PKCE flow 
for secure mobile authentication using the xero-node backend API. Create 
features for receipt capture using device camera with OCR processing 
through Google Vision API to extract vendor, amount, and date. Allow 
offline expense entry with SQLite storage and background sync when 
connected. Implement mileage tracking using device GPS with automatic 
distance calculation. The backend should create bills in Xero with 
attached receipt images, handle multi-currency expenses with real-time 
exchange rates, and support approval workflows. Include push notifications 
for expense approval status changes.

Tech Stack: React Native, Node.js backend, SQLite, Google Vision API, Firebase
Key Endpoints: /Invoices (bills), /Attachments, /Currencies, /Contacts
Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for mobile
Implementation Notes: Compress images before upload, implement exponential backoff for sync retries
