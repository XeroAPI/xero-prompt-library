Develop a Kotlin-based Android POS application for small retailers 
that syncs daily sales with Xero. Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication 
using AppAuth library with Chrome Custom Tabs. Build features for 
product catalog management synced with Xero items, barcode scanning 
using ML Kit, and offline transaction processing with Room database. 
Add support for multiple payment methods including cash, card (via 
Square Reader SDK), and digital wallets. Implement end-of-day 
reconciliation that creates summarized invoices in Xero with payment 
allocations. Include inventory count features, customer loyalty 
program with points tracking, and multi-language support. Use Jetpack 
Compose for modern UI, Hilt for dependency injection, and WorkManager 
for background synchronization.

Tech Stack: Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Room, Retrofit, Square SDK
Key Endpoints: /Invoices, /Items, /Payments, /Contacts
Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with PKCE
Implementation Notes: Implement offline-first architecture,
