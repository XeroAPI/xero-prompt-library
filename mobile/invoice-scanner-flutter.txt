Develop a Flutter mobile application for iOS and Android that captures 
and processes invoices for Xero integration. Build a Node.js backend 
with Express that handles OAuth 2.0 authentication with PKCE flow. 
Implement document scanning using Flutter's camera plugin with edge 
detection and perspective correction. Use Google's ML Kit for 
on-device text recognition to extract invoice details. The backend 
should validate extracted data, match against existing contacts in 
Xero, and create draft bills for review. Include features for batch 
scanning, automatic categorization using machine learning, and 
offline capability with sync queue. Add biometric authentication 
and encrypted local storage for sensitive data.

Tech Stack: Flutter 3.0+, Dart, Node.js, MongoDB, Google ML Kit
Key Endpoints: /Invoices, /Contacts, /Attachments, /Accounts
Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with PKCE
Implementation Notes: Implement image compression before upload, 
use Provider for state management
