Build a Symfony application that automates accounts payable workflows 
integrated with Xero. Use xero-php-oauth2 with Symfony's HTTP client 
for API communication. Create vendor portals for invoice submission 
with automatic three-way matching against purchase orders and receipts. 
Implement OCR processing for scanned invoices using Tesseract, 
extracting line items and automatically creating bills in Xero. 
Add approval workflows with email notifications, automatic payment 
scheduling based on terms, and early payment discount optimization. 
Include duplicate invoice detection using fuzzy matching, spend 
analytics dashboards, and integration with banking APIs for payment 
execution. Implement comprehensive audit trails and SOX compliance reporting.

Tech Stack: Symfony 6, PHP 8.1+, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Tesseract OCR
Key Endpoints: /Invoices (bills), /PurchaseOrders, /Payments, /Contacts
Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with league/oauth2-client
Implementation Notes: Use Symfony Messenger for async processing, implement Doctrine event listeners for audit logs
