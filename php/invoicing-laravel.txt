Create a Laravel application that generates and manages e-invoices 
synchronized with Xero. Use the xero-php-oauth2 SDK with Laravel's 
service container for dependency injection. Build a customer portal 
where clients can view invoices, make payments via Stripe, and 
download PDF invoices generated with DOMPDF. Implement automated 
invoice generation from project milestones tracked in the system, 
with line items pulled from timesheet entries. Add support for 
recurring invoices using Laravel's task scheduler, multi-language 
invoice templates, and automatic late payment reminders. Include 
webhook endpoints for Xero invoice updates and implement two-way 
sync to handle invoice edits from either system.

Tech Stack: Laravel 9+, PHP 8.1+, MySQL, Redis, Stripe, DOMPDF
Key Endpoints: /Invoices, /Contacts, /Payments, /OnlineInvoices
Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with Laravel Socialite provider
Implementation Notes: Use Laravel queues for PDF generation, implement database transactions for payment processing
