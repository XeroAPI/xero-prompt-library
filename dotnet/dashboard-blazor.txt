Create a Blazor WebAssembly application with .NET Core backend that provides 
real-time financial dashboards using Xero data. Use Xero-NetStandard SDK 
with ASP.NET Core Identity for authentication. Build interactive charts using 
ChartJS showing cash flow, revenue trends, and expense breakdowns with 
drill-down capabilities. Implement SignalR for live updates when new 
transactions are recorded. Add features for budget vs actual comparisons, 
financial forecasting using ML.NET, and automated report generation with PDF 
export. Include multi-organization support with tenant isolation, role-based 
access control, and audit logging. Implement data caching with Redis and 
background synchronization using Hangfire.

Tech Stack: .NET 6+, Blazor WebAssembly, SQL Server, Redis, SignalR, ML.NET
Key Endpoints: /Reports/*, /Invoices, /BankTransactions, /Accounts
Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with IdentityServer4
Implementation Notes: Use IMemoryCache for frequently accessed data, 
implement repository pattern with Entity Framework Core
