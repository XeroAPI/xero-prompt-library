Build an Angular-based manufacturing ERP system with NestJS backend 
that integrates production workflows with Xero accounting. Implement 
OAuth 2.0 using Passport.js strategies and JWT tokens for session 
management. Create Angular modules for production planning, work 
order management, and bill of materials tracking that automatically 
update Xero inventory levels and COGS. Add features for quality 
control with cost of rework tracking, machine maintenance scheduling 
with expense allocation, and real-time production dashboards. 
Implement barcode scanning for inventory movements, automatic 
purchase order generation for raw materials, and job costing with 
variance analysis. Use RxJS for reactive data flows and implement 
real-time updates with Socket.io.

Tech Stack: Angular 14+, NestJS, TypeORM, PostgreSQL, Redis, Socket.io
Key Endpoints: /Items, /PurchaseOrders, /Invoices, /ManualJournals
Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with Passport.js
Implementation Notes: Use interceptors for API error handling, 
implement database migrations with TypeORM
