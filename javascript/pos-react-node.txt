Develop a React-based POS system with Node.js backend that syncs daily sales 
from multiple retail locations to Xero. Create a React admin dashboard showing 
real-time sales data across stores with Material-UI components. The backend 
should batch process end-of-day sales using the xero-node SDK, creating 
summarized invoices per store with proper tracking categories. Implement 
inventory synchronization that updates Xero stock levels after each sale and 
triggers purchase orders when items hit reorder points. Add offline mode with 
IndexedDB for network interruptions and queue-based syncing when connection 
resumes. Include role-based access control and store-specific reporting.

Tech Stack: React 18, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Redis Queue, Material-UI
Key Endpoints: /Invoices, /Items, /TrackingCategories, /PurchaseOrders
Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with Custom Connections for server-to-server
Implementation Notes: Use tracking categories for store locations, implement connection pooling for multi-tenant architecture
