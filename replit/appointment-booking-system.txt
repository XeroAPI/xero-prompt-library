Make a booking website where clients can see your availability and schedule appointments. 
Send automatic confirmation emails and reminders. 
Design it with a clean calendar interface and modern booking flow.

Integrate this with my Xero account using the Xero API via a 'custom connection' 
It should create a contact for the person that books the appointment and send them an invoice for the appointment cost. 
A link to the invoice in Xero should be sent in the email and email reminders.

Please set a client id and a client secret for a Xero API custom connection 
rather than providing an access token. 
You can find how custom connections work using the client credentials OAuth 2 grant type here:

Provide a link to an online invoice when the appointment has been booked.
The instructions on how to get an online invoice url are here:
