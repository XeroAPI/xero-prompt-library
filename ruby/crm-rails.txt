Build a Ruby on Rails CRM that seamlessly integrates customer data and 
sales pipeline with Xero accounting. Use the xero-ruby gem with Rails 
encrypted credentials for secure key storage. Create models for leads, 
opportunities, and quotes that automatically convert to Xero invoices 
upon deal closure. Implement background jobs with Sidekiq for syncing 
contact updates bi-directionally, ensuring data consistency. Add 
features for credit limit management based on payment history from Xero, 
automated statement generation, and customer portal with self-service 
invoice access. Include ActionCable for real-time updates when invoices 
are paid, and implement comprehensive caching with Redis to minimize 
API calls.

Tech Stack: Ruby on Rails 7, PostgreSQL, Sidekiq, Redis, ActionCable
Key Endpoints: /Contacts, /Invoices, /CreditNotes, /Payments
Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with OmniAuth strategy
Implementation Notes: Use Rails concerns for Xero synchronization logic, 
implement optimistic locking for concurrent updates
