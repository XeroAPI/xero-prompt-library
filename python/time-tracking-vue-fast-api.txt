Create a modern time tracking application using Vue.js 3 frontend and 
Python FastAPI backend that integrates with Xero for automated invoicing. 
Implement JWT authentication with OAuth 2.0 flow to Xero using httpx 
async client. Build a responsive Vue.js interface with Vuetify components 
for time entry, project management, and team scheduling. The FastAPI 
backend should aggregate timesheet data and generate draft invoices in 
Xero based on hourly rates and project budgets. Include features for 
expense attachment to timesheets, automatic overtime calculations, and 
client approval workflows. Implement WebSocket connections for real-time 
team availability updates and PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy for data 
persistence.

Tech Stack: Vue.js 3, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, WebSockets
Key Endpoints: /Invoices, /Projects, /Contacts, /TrackingCategories
Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with Authlib
Implementation Notes: Use Pydantic for data validation, 
implement row-level security in PostgreSQL
