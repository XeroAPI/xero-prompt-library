Build a Django application that synchronizes Shopify orders with Xero invoices. 
Use the xero-python SDK to implement OAuth 2.0 authentication with session storage. 
Create a background Celery task that polls Shopify's REST API every 15 minutes for 
new orders and automatically creates corresponding invoices in Xero with proper 
tax handling, inventory tracking, and payment status. Include webhook endpoints 
to receive real-time updates from both Shopify and Xero for order status changes. 
Map Shopify SKUs to Xero item codes, handle multi-currency transactions, and 
implement proper error handling with retry logic for failed API calls. Add a Django 
admin interface showing synchronization status and error logs.

Tech Stack: Python 3.8+, Django 4.0+, Celery, Redis, PostgreSQL, xero-python SDK
Key Endpoints: /Invoices, /Items, /Contacts, /Payments
Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with django-allauth integration
Implementation Notes: Use Django's ORM for mapping tables, implement idempotency keys to prevent duplicate invoices
