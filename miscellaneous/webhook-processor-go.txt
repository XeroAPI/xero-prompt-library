Develop a high-performance Go service that processes Xero webhooks 
and maintains an event-sourced ledger of all accounting changes. 
Implement webhook signature verification using HMAC SHA256 and 
store events in EventStore. Build REST APIs using Gin framework 
to query the event stream and reconstruct account states at any 
point in time. Add Apache Kafka producers to stream events to 
downstream systems for real-time analytics. Implement CQRS 
pattern with separate read models in PostgreSQL for complex 
queries. Include circuit breakers for Xero API calls, comprehensive 
monitoring with Prometheus metrics, and distributed tracing with 
Jaeger. Deploy using Docker with Kubernetes orchestration.

Tech Stack: Go 1.19+, Gin, EventStore, PostgreSQL, Kafka, Redis
Key Endpoints: Webhook endpoints, /Connections for tenant management
Authentication: Custom Connections for machine-to-machine
Implementation Notes: Use goroutines for concurrent processing, 
implement at-least-once delivery semantics
