Develop a Spring Boot microservice for inventory management that maintains 
real-time synchronization with Xero. Use the Xero-Java SDK with Spring's 
OAuth2 client for authentication. Implement REST APIs for stock movements, 
transfers between locations, and cycle counting that automatically update 
Xero inventory levels. Add Apache Kafka integration for event-driven updates 
from warehouse management systems. Include features for automatic purchase 
order generation based on reorder points, supplier performance tracking, 
and ABC analysis for inventory optimization. Implement batch processing 
for bulk inventory adjustments using Spring Batch, with comprehensive audit 
logging and rollback capabilities. Add Swagger documentation and monitoring 
with Micrometer metrics.

Tech Stack: Java 11+, Spring Boot 2.7+, PostgreSQL, Apache Kafka, Redis
Key Endpoints: /Items, /PurchaseOrders, /Invoices, /TrackingCategories
Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with Spring Security OAuth2
Implementation Notes: Use database sequences for idempotency, implement circuit breakers with Resilience4j
